#### Research Experience

1. Undergraduate Researcher| Seoul National University (Jan 2024 – Present)

Project: Unitary Synthesis using GFlowNets

Developing a novel reinforcement learning algorithm based on Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to discover and construct optimal quantum circuits.

This research aims to significantly improve the efficiency of unitary synthesis, a fundamental challenge in quantum computing.

The goal is to produce a first-author publication for a top-tier journal such as Nature or Physical Review Letters.

#### Certifications & Awards

1. 2023 Artificial Intelligence Competition for Product Recognition of Unmanned Vendors based on Deep Learning: 1st Prize
September ~ November 2022.
Hosted by POLARIS Innovation Sharing University, Seoul National University. Organized by AI Semiconductor Engineering, Joint Major, Seoul National University
(Work) Created and trained DL model for item segmentation. Fine-tuned our model from
pretained YOLO v7 (Trainable bag-of-freebies). Result showed over 90% of item storage and segmentation.

2. Classification and recycling challenge of AI object recognition-based resources: 2nd Prize
August 2022.
Hosted by Consortium of Korea University's Engineering Education Innovation Center. Organized by Robot SC, and Renewable Energy SC
(Work) Worked on developing self-driving robots using Lego Spike Prime and Raspberry PI. Created a two-wheel robot that determines recycling resources using Camera based Open CV, purposed to clean up resources in city environment. Utilized ultrasonic sensors and servo
motors for automatic control.
